description: A stock shadcn site plus one scoped structural theme — and the record of why that theme is structural only, after a first attempt recoloured two pages into looking like a different company.

# Overview

The site is **stock shadcn/ui on the slate base colour** (`components.json`), with a
single scoped variant called **Ledger** applied to `/free-website` and `/products/*`.

Everything is themed through the CSS-variable indirection shadcn already uses —
`hsl(var(--primary))` and friends, defined in `app/globals.css`.

# Ledger

```css
.theme-ledger {
  --radius: 0px;
  --ochre: 221 83% 53%;        /* = --primary */
  --rule-strong: 215 25% 27%;  /* = --foreground */
}
```

That is the whole theme. **It changes structure, not colour.** Squared corners, hairline
rules, ruled rows instead of card grids, index numbers with `tabular-nums`, and small
uppercase labels at `tracking-[0.14em]`.

`--ochre` and `--rule-strong` are the only genuinely new Tailwind keys
(`tailwind.config.ts`), and both currently alias existing brand values. The names are
vestigial — see below.

## Why it is structural only

The first version was a full palette: warm paper background, ochre accent, ink text. It
shipped, and the founder's response to the deployed page was *"its color doesnt match
our site, looks odd."*

Measured against the rest of the site, that version shifted the foreground hue by 170°
and the primary by 164°. Two pages read as a different company sitting behind the same
navbar. The mistake was spending the "sharp break" budget on **palette** when the thing
that actually felt generic was **structure** — pill badges above every h1, gradient icon
tiles, an identical hero block on all 14 interior pages.

Structure carries the distinctiveness; colour carries the brand. Keep them separate.

`--ochre` kept its name so the diff that neutralised it stays legible. Renaming it to
`--accent` would erase the record of a decision worth remembering.

## How it is applied

`components/ThemeScope.tsx` — a client component reading `usePathname()`, wrapping
Navbar + main + Footer in the root layout so the squared radius reaches the chrome and
there is no visible seam at the header.

**Not a route group.** Group layouts nest *inside* `app/layout.tsx` rather than replacing
it, so swapping chrome that way would mean relocating all 14 existing page directories
and stranding `app/not-found.tsx`. The pathname wrapper is one line for the same result.

Server children passed through a client component stay server-rendered — nothing in the
existing tree became client-side because of this.

**Known seam:** sonner and radix-toast portal into `document.body`, so they escape the
scope and render in the default theme. Acceptable for something transient, but it is a
seam, not an oversight. `components/free-website/ApplyForm.tsx` sidesteps it by replacing
itself with its confirmation rather than firing a toast.

# Traps

**Parallel Tailwind colour keys do not theme shadcn.** `components/ui/button.tsx`
hardcodes `bg-primary`. Adding a `paper` colour key would leave an indigo button sitting
on a themed page. Redefine the existing CSS variables inside a scope class instead — the
`hsl(var(--x))` indirection is the mechanism, not an obstacle.

**`data/` must be in the Tailwind content globs.** It is now
(`"./data/**/*.{ts,tsx}"`); without it any class name stored in a data file is purged
silently in production and looks fine in dev.

**`font-heading` is referenced but never defined** in `Navbar.tsx` and `Footer.tsx`. It
resolves to nothing. Naming any new display family `heading` would silently restyle the
wordmark on every page.

# Not done yet

**Archivo** (variable `wdth` axis) was planned as the display face and deliberately
deferred: changing the typeface while the layout was still moving makes it impossible to
tell which change broke the rhythm. If added, it goes in a **scoped** component — putting
it in the root layout makes all 14 existing pages preload a font they never use — and via
`next/font/google` with `axes: ["wdth"]` and **no** `weight` key, or the build throws.

The other 14 pages still use the original look. Migrating them is page-by-page work that
has not started.
